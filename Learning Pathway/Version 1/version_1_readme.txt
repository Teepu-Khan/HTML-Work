In the first step of my learning path, I implemented the following basic functions into an
extremely simple web page: 

- headers
- body
- div
- title
- unordered list
- basic image display
- paragraph
- anchor (specifically, a link)
- basic video display

Keep in mind this is the earliest stage of the web page, and as such will be very rough and
missing a majority of functionality.
