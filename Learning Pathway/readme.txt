In this folder, you will find the web page(s) I designed in the process of me learning how to
properly use HTML an associated tools. Each folder will be labelled with a version number
indicating which step of the learning process it is. 

I will also include a readme within each folder to explain the main topics explored and
implemented within that phase of the project.

NOTE: None of these are published, so if you want to view them in action you'll have to download
everything within the folder and keep it within the folder. index.html will always be the main
page, and that's the one you'll want to open to start.
